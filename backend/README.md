# BPMN Redrawer

This repository contains the backend code for the BPMN Redrawer project, developed during the Software Project Management course at University of Camerino.

The project consists of implementing a web application that allows to upload .png images of BPMN models in order to turn those images in actual BPMN models stored in .bpmn format.
